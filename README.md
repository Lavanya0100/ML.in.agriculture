README: Crop Prediction Using Soil Type with Random Forest
Welcome to the repository for our research paper on "Predicting Crop Types Based on Soil Characteristics Using Random Forest". This study explores the application of machine learning techniques, specifically Random Forest, to predict suitable crop types based on soil type data.

Overview
The research aims to enhance agricultural planning by providing a predictive model that can assist farmers and agronomists in selecting optimal crops for various soil types. Our approach leverages a Random Forest algorithm to analyze soil characteristics and forecast the most appropriate crops, potentially improving yield and sustainability.

Contents
Data: Includes soil type datasets used for training and testing the model.
Code: Python scripts implementing the Random Forest model and data preprocessing.
Results: Evaluation metrics and predictions for different soil types.
Documentation: Detailed explanation of the methodology, including data preparation, model training, and evaluation.
